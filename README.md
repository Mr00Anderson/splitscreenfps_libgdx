# Split-Screen FPS Games
A 1-4 player split-screen FPS engine and games.

I have a very short attention span: this codebase contains various games, and I work on whichever one interests me at any moment in time (or I start work on a new one).  The games that are selectable from the first menu are typically mostly complete.


## Controls
it depends on the specific game, but controls are typically:-

* W, A S, D, Space and Enter for keyboard & mouse player.
* Tested with PS4 controllers.
* F1 - Toggle full Screen
* F2 - Toggle full screen but still windowed (required if you want to record the screen using Windows)
